# Kotlin Password Manager Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn Kotlin so I can build an Andriod app in the near future and will contain the fundamental aspects of Kotlin I need to know in order to do that. In order to do this, I created a fundamental password manager that contains the following:

- Variables (mutable and immutable)
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes

The password manager first asks the user to create an account or login and stores the user's info in a file. Once they are logged in, they are able to input a website and a username and password for that websites which is stored the user's password file. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used IDEA to build the software. The program is written in Kotlin and the only library I used was java.io.File to write the files.
