# Kotlin Password Manager Overview

The purpose of this project is to learn Kotlin so I can build an Andriod app in the near future and will contain the fundamental aspects of Kotlin I need to know in order to do that. In order to do this, I created a fundamental password manager that contains the following:

- Variables (mutable and immutable)
- Expressions
- Conditionals
- Loops
- Functions
- Classes

The password manager first asks the user to create an account or login and stores the user's info in a file. Once they are logged in, they are able to input a website and a username and password for that websites which is stored the user's password file. Here is a link of a video a made going through the program:

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ Idea for my IDE which is like Visual Studio Code but has Kotlin support installed by default to build the software. The program is written in Kotlin and the only library I used was java.io.File to write the files I worked with.
